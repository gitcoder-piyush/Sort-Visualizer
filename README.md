# How It Works?

In this model, each element of array is represented by a bar. The length of a bar depends upon size of corresponding elemnet. The algorithms moves the bars by swapping elements without creating any additional array. The initial bar is represented by "cyan" color. Current compared bars/elements are colored differently. The final sorted bars/elements are represented by "green" color.
